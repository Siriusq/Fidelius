Fidelius is a password generator based on the [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) cryptographic algorithm. It uses the memorised password as the main password P and the domain identifier and generation time as the hash salt S. The two are hashed several times and then the [SeekPassword](https://github.com/Wsine/seekpassword) algorithm is used to further process the outcome to obtain the password required by the user.

## Features
- Based on the Argon2 algorithm, which won the Password Hashing Competition in 2015 and is effective against brute force cracking (including GPU-based brute force cracking).
- The recommended parameters of Argon2 are used by default, but you can also change them yourself.
- Password generation date can be added to the hash salt to easily change the password periodically in the future.
- Customisable special symbols used in passwords.
- All operations run locally, and the code is open source.
